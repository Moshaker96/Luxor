            <h3>I. The Lineage: Inspired by Antiquity</h3>
            <p>
                Our name, **LUXOR**, is an ode to the ancient city of Thebes—a place where architectural harmony and art reached their zenith. We draw inspiration from the **geometric precision** of pharaonic monuments, the protective symbolism of the Eye of Horus, and the deep, rich colors of Lapis Lazuli and Gold that adorned royalty. This history is not merely decoration; it is the **design philosophy** that guides every stitch.

            <h3>II. The Craftsmanship: Egyptian Linen, Uncompromised</h3>
            <p>
                True luxury begins with the material. Our signature fabric is **Extra-Long Staple (ELS) Egyptian Linen**, a textile cherished by history for its unparalleled breathability, resilience, and softness. Unlike mass-produced garments, every LUXOR piece is an **investment**—crafted by skilled local artisans who honor traditional techniques while adhering to uncompromising modern tailoring standards. This ensures every tunic and garment is built to become a modern heirloom.

            <h3>III. Our Vision: Sustainable Elegance</h3>
            <p>
                LUXOR is committed to a slow fashion model. We produce **limited collections** to eliminate waste and maintain exclusivity. We believe in transparency, sustainable sourcing, and creating pieces that stand the test of time, both in style and durability. Wear LUXOR, and carry the legacy of Kemet with modern grace and conscience.
